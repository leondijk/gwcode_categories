# GWcode Categories
## Free plugin for ExpressionEngine 3.x
#### By Leon Dijk - [@GWcode](http://twitter.com/#!/gwcode)

### Introduction

List all, last child categories, or categories of a certain (minimum, maximum, fixed) depth, for one or more channels, for one or more category groups, for an entry or overall. Get child categories, or parent categories. Show entry count, custom category fields. And more.

If you're having trouble selecting the right categories, this plugin could come in handy.
You basically pick a starting point first to get a list of categories and then narrow it down by choosing from a wide variety of parameters. Your starting point can be:

* One or more channels by using the channel parameter (to get the categories for those channels);
* One or more category groups by using the group_id parameter (to get the categories for those category groups);
* An entry (to get the categories the entry has been added to);
* A category (to get its child categories, or parent categories).
